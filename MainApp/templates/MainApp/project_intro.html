            <h5>Why Map Fear?</h5>
            <p>
                Making art individually and collectively gives us a way to think about and express challenging emotions. In societies that prioritize efficiency, contemplating oneâ€™s fears is often considered futile or unproductive. But fear is one of humanity's oldest, most primal emotions. It helps us grow. It helps us survive. It drives us forward as much as it holds us back, and it deserves to be understood.
            </p>
            <p>
                In sharing time and space with the many people who have added drawings and writings to this project, we have seen that our fear is a window into not just what we dread the most, but also what we hope most to achieve. And if we are able to really focus on and confront our fears, they can guide us forward in challenging times.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this season of uncertainty, I hope this project can provide a space for participants to look at their fears through the lenses of drawing and writing. All entries are anonymous, and no prior experience in art is required.
